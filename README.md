# SonarGUI (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
is a graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python using the tkinter and matplotlib libraries. This project simulates a sonar radar on a polar plot, allowing visualization of detected objects and adjustment of parameters such as angle scale, sonar range, and distance scale. The GUI features continuous scanning, where a "sweep" beam moves across a 180-degree arc, detecting objects in its path.

## Key Features
- **Polar Sonar Plot:** Displays a polar plot simulating sonar scanning.
- **Continuous Sweep:** The sweep beam continuously moves across a 180-degree arc.
- **Object Detection:** Capable of detecting and displaying objects within the sonar range.
- **Parameter Adjustment:** Controls to adjust the angle scale, sonar range, and distance scale.
  
## Usage Instructions
- **Requirements:** Ensure you have tkinter, matplotlib, numpy, and customtkinter installed.
- **Execution:** Run the Python script to launch the GUI.
- **Controls:** Use the input fields and dropdown menus to adjust the sonar parameters as needed
